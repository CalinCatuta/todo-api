The Singleton pattern is a design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.
In this API, we used it in Database.php to manage the database connection:

private static $instance = null;
public static function getInstance() {
    if (self::$instance === null) {
        self::$instance = new self();
    }
    return self::$instance;
}

Efficient Resource Management:
Database connections are expensive to create (e.g., establishing a TCP connection, authenticating, and initializing). Using a Singleton ensures only one PDO connection is created and reused across your application, reducing overhead and memory usage.

Global Access:
It provides a single, predictable way to access the database connection from anywhere in your code (e.g., User.php, Todo.php), avoiding the need to pass the connection object around or create multiple instances.

Scalability for Your Project:
For a small Todo API, a Singleton is simple and effective. It prevents redundant connections, which is especially important if your API scales to handle many simultaneous requests or if you add more complex operations.





Potential Drawbacks (Real-World Considerations)
Testing: Singletons can make unit testing harder because they introduce global state. In a real-world project, you might mock or inject dependencies instead (e.g., using dependency injection containers like PHP-DI or Laravel’s container).

Scalability: For very large applications or microservices, a Singleton might not scale well if you need multiple database connections or connection pooling. In such cases, you’d use a connection pool or a framework’s database manager (e.g., Doctrine, Laravel Eloquent).

In this Project: For a small Todo API, the Singleton is appropriate and simple, but as it grows, you might consider refactoring to a dependency injection pattern or using a framework with built-in connection management.
